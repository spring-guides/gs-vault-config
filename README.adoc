This guide walks you through the process of using http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/[Spring Cloud Vault] to build an application that retrieves its configuration properties from https://www.vaultproject.io[HashiCorp Vault].

== What you'll build

You'll start up Vault, store configuration properties inside Vault, build a Spring application and connect it with Vault.

== What you'll need

== Install and launch HashiCorp Vault

With your project set up, you can install and launch HashiCorp Vault.


If you are using a Mac with homebrew, this is as simple as:

    $ brew install vault

Alternatively, download Vault for your operating system from https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads.html:

    $ https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/0.10.2/vault_0.10.2_darwin_amd64.zip
    $ unzip vault_0.10.2_darwin_amd64

For other systems with package management, such as Redhat, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and Windows, see instructions at https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/index.html.

After you install Vault, launch it in a console window. This command also starts up a server process.

    $ vault server --dev --dev-root-token-id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

You should see the following as one of the last output lines:

....
[INFO ] core: post-unseal setup complete
....

NOTE: The command above starts Vault in development mode using in-memory storage without transport encryption. This is fine
for evaluating Vault locally. Make sure to use proper SSL certificates and a reliable storage backend for production use.
Consult Vault's https://www.vaultproject.io/guides/production.html[Production Hardening guide] for further details.

== Store configuration in Vault

Vault is a secrets management system allowing you to store sensitive data which is encrypted at rest.
It's ideal to store sensitive configuration details such as passwords, encryption keys, API keys.

Launch another console window to store application configuration in Vault using the Vault command line.

First, you need to set two environment variables to point the Vault CLI to the Vault endpoint and provide
an authentication token.

    $ export VAULT_TOKEN="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    $ export VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"

Now you can store a configuration key-value pairs inside Vault:

    $ vault kv put secret/gs-vault-config example.username=demouser example.password=demopassword
    $ vault kv put secret/gs-vault-config/cloud example.username=clouduser example.password=cloudpassword

Now you have written two entries in Vault `secret/gs-vault` and `secret/gs-vault-config/cloud`.

== Define your configuration class

Create a simple configuration for your Spring application:

`src/main/java/hello/MyConfiguration.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/MyConfiguration.java[]
----

== Configure your application

Here you configure your application with `bootstrap.properties`. Spring Cloud Vault operates in the bootstrap context to initially
obtain configuration properties so it can provide these to the auto-configuration and your application itself.

`src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties`
[source,properties]
----
include::complete/src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties[]
----

== Create an Application class

Here you create an Application class with all the components.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

Spring Cloud Vault uses `VaultOperations` to interact with Vault. Properties from Vault get mapped to
`MyConfiguration` for type-safe access. `@EnableConfigurationProperties(MyConfiguration.class)` enables configuration property
mapping and registers a `MyConfiguration` bean.

`Application` includes a `main()` method that autowires an instance of `MyConfiguration`.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]

As our `Application` implements `CommandLineRunner`, the `run` method is invoked automatically when boot
starts. You should see something like this:
....
----------------------------------------
Configuration properties
        example.username is demouser
        example.password is demopassword
----------------------------------------
....

Now start your application with the `cloud` profile activated. You should see something like this:
....
----------------------------------------
Configuration properties
        example.username is clouduser
        example.password is cloudpassword
----------------------------------------
....

Configuration properties are bound according to the activated profiles. Spring Cloud Vault constructs a Vault context path
from `spring.application.name` which is `gs-vault` and appends the profile name (`cloud`) so enabling the `cloud` profile
will fetch additionally configuration properties from `secret/gs-vault-config/cloud`.

== Summary

Congratulations! You set up a Vault server and wrote a simple application that uses Spring Vault to read
secrets into configuration properties and encrypt data with a strong cipher — all without the headache of
implementing key management, a cipher mode, and padding.
