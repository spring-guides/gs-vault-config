This guide walks you through the process of using https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/[Spring Cloud Vault] to build an application that retrieves its configuration properties from https://www.vaultproject.io[HashiCorp Vault].

== What You Will Build

You'll start up Vault, store configuration properties inside Vault, build a Spring application and connect it with Vault.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use this https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&packaging=jar&groupId=org.springframework&artifactId=gs-vault-config&name=gs-vault-config&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=org.springframework.gs-vault-config&dependencies=cloud-starter-vault-config[pre-initialized project^] and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Vault Configuration*
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of an application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

== Run HashiCorp Vault

An instance of HashiCorp Vault is required to complete this guide.
This guide uses Docker Compose to run a containerized version of HashiCorp Vault.
A `compose.yaml` file has been provided:
[source,yaml]
----
include::compose.yaml[]
----

Run the HashiCorp Vault container with the `docker compose up` command.

== Store Configuration in Vault

Vault is a secrets management system allowing you to store sensitive data which is encrypted at rest.

You need to access the Vault container to store the data.
Connect to the running Docker container with the command:
[source,shell]
----
docker exec -it guide-vault sh
----

You are now running commands inside of the HashiCorp Vault container.

First, you need to set two environment variables to point the Vault CLI to the Vault endpoint and provide
an authentication token.
[source,shell]
----
export VAULT_TOKEN="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
export VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"
----

Now you can store configuration key-value pairs inside Vault.
For this guide, you store two key-value pairs:

[source,shell]
----
vault kv put secret/gs-vault-config example.username=demouser example.password=demopassword
vault kv put secret/gs-vault-config/cloud example.username=clouduser example.password=cloudpassword
----

Now you have written two entries in Vault `secret/gs-vault-config` and `secret/gs-vault-config/cloud`.

With the Vault container running and the data loaded, you are now ready to turn your attention to the Spring application.


== Define your configuration class

Create a simple configuration for your Spring application:

`src/main/java/hello/MyConfiguration.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/MyConfiguration.java[]
----

== Configure your application

Here you configure your application with `application.properties`. The code below uses Spring Boot's Config Data API which allows importing configuration from Vault.

`src/main/resources/application.properties`
[source,properties]
----
include::complete/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

== Create an Application class

Here you create an Application class with all the components.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

Spring Cloud Vault uses `VaultOperations` to interact with Vault. Properties from Vault get mapped to
`MyConfiguration` for type-safe access. `@EnableConfigurationProperties(MyConfiguration.class)` enables configuration property
mapping and registers a `MyConfiguration` bean.

`Application` includes a `main()` method that autowires an instance of `MyConfiguration`.

== Run the Application

You can run the main method through your IDE.
Alternatively, the `./gradlew bootRun` and `./mvnw spring-boot:run` commands launch the application.

As our `Application` implements `CommandLineRunner`, the `run` method is invoked automatically when boot starts. You should see the output:

----
----------------------------------------
Configuration properties
        example.username is demouser
        example.password is demopassword
----------------------------------------
----

Now start the application using the `cloud` profile.
You can do so in Gradle with the `./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=cloud'` command or in Maven with the `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--spring.profiles.active=cloud"` command.
When you run the application with the cloud profile, you see:

----
----------------------------------------
Configuration properties
        example.username is clouduser
        example.password is cloudpassword
----------------------------------------
----

Configuration properties are bound according to the activated profiles. Spring Cloud Vault constructs a Vault context path
from `spring.application.name` which is `gs-vault` and appends the profile name (`cloud`) so enabling the `cloud` profile
will fetch additionally configuration properties from `secret/gs-vault-config/cloud`.

== Summary

Congratulations! You set up a Vault server and wrote a simple application that uses Spring Vault to read
secrets into configuration properties and encrypt data with a strong cipher — all without the headache of
implementing key management, a cipher mode, and padding.
